Key Features of the Implementation:

Automated Documentation Crawling: The server can crawl technical documentation and extract structured information including APIs, concepts, code examples, and dependencies.
Knowledge Graph Extension: Automatically builds a knowledge graph by crawling documentation sites with configurable depth and patterns, perfect for learning new frameworks or packages.
Multiple Extraction Types:

Markdown for readable documentation
Structured JSON for machine-processable data
Link extraction for building comprehensive maps


Integration with Augment Code: Full configuration instructions for both the Settings Panel and settings.json methods.
Extensible Architecture: The plan includes advanced features like:

Persistent storage with SQLite
Caching mechanisms
Custom extraction strategies for different documentation types
Rate limiting and security considerations



Quick Start:

Set up the project structure and install dependencies
Copy the provided server implementation
Configure Augment Code with the MCP server details
Test using the MCP inspector
Start using natural language queries to extend your knowledge graph

The implementation is designed to be production-ready whilst remaining simple enough to customise for your specific needs. The agent will be able to automatically discover and index documentation for any framework or package you're working with, building a comprehensive knowledge graph that enhances its understanding of your technical stack.
